Automated Anomaly Detection for Predictive Maintenance
<br>
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
<br>
Data Quality Check: Check for missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.<br>
Descriptive Statistics: Calculate mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc.<br>
Visualization: Create plots (histograms, box plots, scatter plots) to understand data distribution and relationships.<br>
Time Series Analysis: Examine trends, seasonality, and autocorrelation.<br>
<br>2. Data Cleaning:<br>

Handle Missing Values: Impute or remove missing values based on analysis.<br>
Outlier Detection and Handling: Identify and address outliers using techniques like IQR or <br>standard deviation.<br>
Data Normalization: Scale numerical features to a common range.<br>
<br>3. Feature Engineering:<br>

Time-Based Features: Create features like time of day, day of week, and time since last anomaly.<br>
Rolling Statistics: Calculate rolling mean, median, standard deviation, and variance.<br>
Differencing: Calculate differences between consecutive values to capture trends.<br>
Domain-Specific Features: Consider domain knowledge to create relevant features.<br>
<br>4. Model Selection:<br>

Consider Algorithms: Explore algorithms like Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM, and Autoencoders.<br>
Evaluate Performance: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.<br>
Consider Class Imbalance: If necessary, use techniques like SMOTE or class weights.<br>
<br>5. Model Training:<br>

Split Data: Divide data into training and testing sets.<br>
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model parameters using techniques like grid search or random search.<br>
Train Model: Fit the selected model to the training data.<br>
<br>6. Model Validation:<br>

Evaluate on Test Set: Assess model performance on unseen data using the chosen metrics.<br>
Cross-Validation: Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to improve model generalization.<br>
<br>7. Model Deployment:<br>
